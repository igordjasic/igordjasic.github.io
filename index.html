                            Photography has been a hobby of mine for a while now. I mostly take still, quiet landscape shots with harsh lightning but there is a problem with my pictures. 
                            Because I don't take many pictures of people, I don't show them to many people so I can't improve! Thats where you come in.
                            This website will let you help me by allowing you to select one of my photos from a gallery and leave a professional critique of it, positive or negative. so that I can get better.
